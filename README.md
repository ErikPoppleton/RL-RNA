# RL-RNA

This algorithm is using a multi-branch reinforcement learning algorithm to predict secondary structure of peudoknot-free RNA sequence.
RNAfold is used as the roll-out heuristic algorithm.
ENTRNA (with and without MFE) is used as expert.

Environment requirement:
ENTRNA: https://github.com/sucongzhe/ENTRNA

We did some modifications on the original version of ENTRNA so the new ver of ENTRNA is already inside the folder util. You don't need to download ENTRNA itself from the link above but you need the environments for ENTRNA from the link above. (There is a doc containing ENTRNA environment setting in the main folder)

We call ENTRNA expert with MFE MFE_ENTRNA and ENTRNA expert without MFE NFE_ENTRNA.

There are three versions of this algorithom included in this repository: MFE only, NFE only and MFENFE_2X2.
MFE only is a 4 branch algorithm using only ENTRNA with MFE calculation as an expert.
NFE only is a 4 branch algorithm using only ENTRNA with NFE calculation as an expert.
MFENFE_2X2 is a 2 by 2 branches algorithm using ENTRNA with MFE and without MFE (we call it NFE) as experts.

This respository contains two parts of work: (1) Running the alg iteself and produce an output file. (2) Exporting expert scores and free energy scores of the output file.

****************************
For part 1:

Running the whole algorithm requires three .py files:
(1) Batchrun_for_database_xxxxxxx.py
(2) Main_SeqAttRollOut_RNAfold_xxxxxxx.py
(3) SeqAttRollOut_RNAfold_xxxxxxx.py
And the (1) is the main python file to run. You may want to change the input file's directory and the name of output file.

Input format: 
Example input format is as 5s_Acholeplasma-laidlawii-2_.ct file.

Output format:
A csv file containing the following columns:
(1)'Name', the name of the rna
(2)'Ori_Seq', the sequence of the RNA, notice that if your input RNA use T instead of U, we will automatically. transfer T into U
(3)'Actual_str', the actual structure of the input RNA, if any.
(4)'RNAfold_str', the RNAfold result structure of the input RNA.
(5)'Our_alg_str', the result structure by our alg of the input RNA.
(6)'RNAfold_distance', the distance percentage btw actual structure and structure by RNAfold
(7)'Our_distance', the distance percentage btw actual structure and structure by our alg
(8)'ent_3', sequence entropy with window size three, calculation details referred to Congzhe's paper
(9)'gc_perentage', the percentage of G and C in the input RNA seq.
(10)'ensemble_diversity', calculation details referred to Congzhe's paper
(11)'expected_accuracy', calculation details referred to Congzhe's paper
(12)'fe_per', calculation details referred to Congzhe's paper
(13)'Running_time(sec)', running time for this RNA in seconds

The ExpertRNA implementation linked produces as output a csv with the following columns:

column number	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15	16	17	18	19	20	21	22	23	24	25
Data	Number	Name	Sequence	Actual Structure	RNAfold Structure	ExpertRNA Structure	RNAfold Hamming Distance	ExpertRNA Hamming Distance	ent_3	GC Perentage	Ensemble Diversity	Expected Accuracy	fe_per	Running Time(sec)	Actual Foldability MFE	Actual Foldability NFE	Actual abs Foldability difference	RNAfold Foldability MFE	RNAfold Foldability NFE	RNAfold abs Foldability difference	ExpertRNA Foldability MFE	ExpertRNA Foldability NFE	ExpertRNA abs Foldability 

****************************
For part 2:

Exporting expert scores and free energy scores of the output file from part 1. This part is optional, you can make use of it if you want to know the scores of experts and free energies of the structures.

Input format:
Just the csv file, which is exactly the Output format from part 1.

Output format:
A csv, on top of the output of part 1,  the following columns added:
(1)'Actual_Foldability_MFE', ENTRNA_MFE scores for the actual structure
(2)'Actual_Foldability_WOMFE', ENTRNA_NFE scores for the actual structure
(3)'Actual_abs_Foldability_difference', absolute difference of ENTRNA_MFE and ENTRNA_NFE scores for the actual structure
(4)'RNAfold_Foldability_MFE', ENTRNA_MFE scores for the structure by RNAfold
(5)'RNAfold_Foldability_WOMFE', ENTRNA_NFE scores for the structure by RNAfold
(6)'RNAfold_abs_Foldability_difference', absolute difference of ENTRNA_MFE and ENTRNA_NFE scores for the structure by RNAfold
(7)'Our_Foldability_MFE', ENTRNA_MFE scores for the structure by our alg
(8)'Our_Foldability_WOMFE', ENTRNA_NFE scores for the structure by our alg
(9)'Our_abs_Foldability_difference', absolute difference of ENTRNA_MFE and ENTRNA_NFE scores for the structure by our alg
(10)'Actual_FE', free energy (by. ViennaRNA) for the actual structure
(11)'RNAfold_FE', free energy (by. ViennaRNA) for the structure by RNAfold
(12)'Our_FE', free energy (by. ViennaRNA) for the structure by our alg
