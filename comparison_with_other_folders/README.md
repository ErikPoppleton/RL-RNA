# Comparisons

This folder contains comparisons to two other state-of-the-art folding algorithms, SPOT-RNA and ContraFold.  There are three folders:

* comparison - Contains the datasets, results and scripts used to analyze the results.
* forna_colormaps - The MCC script in analysis_scripts produces the correct/incorrect color maps for visualization at the same time as calculating the MCC.  This folder is just a place to put these files, which are not used.
* graphs - The analysis scripts produce results graphs here.
